# Data-analytics-
This repository contains topics that I am exploring in data science/analytics. I am very new to the field, so some of the files may contain rudimentary tasks. My end goal is to eventually gain the skills to complete one cohesive project. 

File descriptions: 

* Telco Customer Churn Analysis (Descriptive) - EDA 
* NBC News Top Story Headlines - Data collection/ web scrapping
